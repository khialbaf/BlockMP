# Block Indicator
The block marker is from the idea of ​​Mr. Mustafa Pazuki and at the request of several friends, it was designed and developed by
[me](https://khialbaf.github.io/profile)
for use on several platforms.
<br/>
Personally, I don't use this method, but I hope this indicator will be helpful for friends who use this analytical method.
